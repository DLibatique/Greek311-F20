<hr />

<p>Your semester grade in this course will consist of six components:</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="1-attendance-and-participation-20">1. Attendance and Participation (20%)</h2>

<p>Attendance and participation in each class period is essential to build both your knowledge base and a strong classroom community. Participation in this context means coming to class having read or translated the given assignments, bringing any questions that you may have, and joining in our class discussions of grammar and social concepts.</p>

<p>Of course, any number of issues might prevent you from coming to class: illness, family emergencies or obligations, athletic responsibilities, the need for a mental health day, and so on. If you know that you will be absent from a given class period, <strong>please e-mail me before the class period in question to let me know.</strong> You don’t need to specify any reason to me; all I ask is for notification in advance, and then I will excuse your absence! Any absence without a notifying e-mail before class may be excused after the fact for compelling and verifiable reasons (including but not limited to medical emergencies, a sudden death in the family, etc.).</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="2-grammar-quizzes-25">2. Grammar Quizzes (25%)</h2>

<p>There will be ten (10) grammar quizzes administered on Thursdays throughout the semester (exact dates are in the detailed schedule). These quizzes will test your grasp of the vocabulary and the syntactic structures that we will encounter in Aeschines’ text. Some quizzes may include a sight-reading component with passages from the speech that we haven’t translated in class, with appropriate vocabulary and grammar glosses. Each quiz is worth 2.5% of your total semester grade.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="3-secondary-responses-25">3. Secondary Responses (25%)</h2>

<p>Throughout the semester, there will be ten (10) secondary reading assignments outside of the primary text (Aeschines’ <em>Against Timarchus</em>). For each, you will be asked to write and submit a 1-2pp. response to discussion questions that I will provide on a rolling basis. Bullet points are okay if they summarize your thoughts better than a narrative format! We will use these responses as material for our class discussions. Each response is due by the beginning of the class period to which it’s assigned, and each response is worth 2.5% of your total semester grade.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="4-discussion-lead-10">4. Discussion Lead (10%)</h2>

<p>Once this semester, you will lead the class’ translation of and discussion about one chapter of the Greek! You will be expected to understand the vocabulary and grammar contained in your chapter, as well as its context and importance in the speech as a whole. Part of this discussion lead assignment will be <strong>two mandatory one-on-one meetings</strong> with me in Student Hours (or a time by appointment), the first so that we can make sure that you have all the information that you need and that you’re primed for success in leading the class’ discussion, and the second so that we can debrief and identify successes and opportunities for improvement.</p>

<p><a href="#top">Back to top.</a></p>

<hr />

<h2 id="5-midterm-and-final-paper-or-exam-15-each">5. Midterm and Final Paper or Exam (15% each)</h2>

<p>Twice in the semester (in the middle and at the end), you will decide whether you will write a paper or take an exam. I prefer that you make your own choices rather than I dictate one format for the entire class, as some students prefer studying for exams, while others prefer writing papers. A midterm exam will be administered in class on Th 10/15 (the last class before fall break), while a midterm paper will be due via e-mail at the end point of that class period. Similarly, a final exam will be administered during the exam period, while a final paper will be due via e-mail at the end point of that exam.</p>

<p>Specific guidelines for the papers will be provided as the time nears, but in general, the papers are meant to be essays that advance a specific argument supported by ample primary and secondary evidence. Exams will test grammar and comprehension of our main text and passages at sight; the midterm will cover the first half of the semester while the final will cover the second (i.e., it will not be cumulative).</p>

<hr />

<h2 id="final-semester-tally">Final Semester Tally</h2>

<p>The final grade will be calculated as a percentage out of 100; then, it will be converted to a letter grade according to the following scheme:</p>

<p>A+ = 97-100%; A = 94-96%; A- = 90-93%<br />
 B+ = 87-89%; B = 84-86%; B- = 80-83% <br />
C+ = 77-79%; C = 74-76%; C- = 70-73%<br />
 D = 65-69%; F = 0-64%</p>

<p>Grades ending in .45 or greater will be rounded up to the nearest whole number; grades ending in .44 or less will be rounded down to the nearest whole number.</p>
