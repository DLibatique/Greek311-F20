<h2 id="academic-conduct">Academic Conduct</h2>
<p>You are expected to abide by Reed’s academic conduct policy, posted <a href="https://www.reed.edu/academic/gbook/comm_pol/acad_conduct.html">here</a>. Cheating on quizzes or exams or plagiarism on any of the written assignments (defined here as but not limited to reproducing answers from an answer key, referring to forbidden notes to help answer questions, copying another student’s answers, or copying another writer’s ideas without proper citation or attribution) may result in penalties ranging from a failure on the specific assignment, quiz, or exam to failure for the entire course.</p>

<h2 id="student-hours">Student Hours</h2>
<p>Student hours are an opportunity for you to meet with me outside of class to discuss anything you’d like: questions about the readings, clarifications about assignments or grammar, even simply shooting the breeze. My student hours are times that I am sure to be in my office, unless you’re notified otherwise, so I highly encourage you to take advantage of them! I’m also happy to make appointments outside of my regular student hours if they conflict with your availability; simply shoot me an e-mail with what times and dates work for you.</p>

<h2 id="gender-expression-and-identity">Gender Expression and Identity</h2>
<p>I (Prof. Libatique) am a cisgender man and use he/him/his pronouns. Your first assignment will be to fill out a form to let me know what your preferred name is, what pronouns you use, and what you hope to learn from this class. My goal is to avoid dead-naming, as your preferred name may not match the legal name on my class roster.</p>

<h2 id="diversity-inclusion-and-respect">Diversity, Inclusion, and Respect</h2>
<p>Studying the ancient world at Reed is one way to challenge a centuries-long tradition that reserved the study of the ancient world for a privileged elite. As we learn about the multicultural world of the ancient Mediterranean through literature and art, we should reflect on and actively explore how this study can help us recognize and respond to structures of power and privilege in our own lives. This work is especially important today, when historically false images of the ancient world are being invoked to support particular political viewpoints. Studying the ancient world helps us see through erroneous assertions about the “whiteness” or “heteronormativity” of the ancient Mediterranean, and reject claims that the Greco-Roman world is the special province of any ethnic or political group.</p>

<p>Our course will encompass topics which will sometimes require us to have difficult conversations with conflicting viewpoints. Our classroom is designated as a space where respectful dialogue must be the norm: <em>ad hominem</em> attacks, unsubstantiated generalizations, and discriminatory remarks of any kind will not be tolerated. All students are welcome in this class and at Reed, no matter how they identify their race, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, religious or spiritual tradition, or socioeconomic background. If there is disagreement, we will work with the ideas being discussed; no personal attacks will be allowed.</p>

<p>We will also engage in discussions about the practices and norms of cultures that in many respects differ from our own, practices that may perhaps strike modern sensibilities as objectionable or crude. One of the major themes with which we will engage this semester is how our understanding of what is acceptable or unacceptable is largely constructed by cultural context. We must engage with the evidence of ancient texts and material culture in terms of the cultures in which they were created, without making value judgments according to our modern sensibilities; or, at the very least, we must interrogate why and how we are making those value judgments.</p>

<h2 id="content-warnings">Content Warnings</h2>
<p>At times this semester we will be discussing literature, material culture, and topics that may be disturbing, even traumatizing, to some students. Some topics that will come up include pederasty and prostitution. If you suspect that specific material is likely to be emotionally challenging for you, I’d be happy to discuss any concerns that you may have before the subject comes up in class either via e-mail or in person (in office hours or through an appointment). I will do my best to place content warnings on readings in the course schedule whose titles may not necessarily indicate the presence of traumatizing material.</p>

<p>If you ever wish to discuss your personal reactions to course material with the class or with me individually afterward, I welcome such discussions as an appropriate part of our course. If you ever feel the need to step outside during a class discussion, you may always do so without academic penalty, but you will be responsible for any missed material. If you leave the room for a significant amount of time, please make arrangements to get notes from another student or to see me individually to discuss the situation.</p>

<h2 id="accessibility">Accessibility</h2>
<p>Any student who needs accommodations based on the impact of a disability should contact Disability &amp; Accessibility Resources to discuss support services available at <a href="https://www.reed.edu/disability-resources/students/accommodation-process.html">this link</a>. Please feel empowered to discuss with me directly whatever you need to succeed in this course, whether that includes extra time on assignments, flexibility with due dates, and so on.</p>
