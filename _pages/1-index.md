This course explores Aeschines’ speech *Against Timarchus*, in which he accuses his political rival Timarchus of having been a prostitute, a fact which would preclude Timarchus from certain citizenship rights. The goals of this course are threefold: first, to build a strong grammatical and syntactic command of Attic Greek and Aeschines’ style; second, to explore the importance of rhetoric and persuasion both in the Classical Greek context and the modern day; third, to investigate how the construction of sexual rules impacts participation and hierarchies in society or, put differently, how the private affects the public and vice versa. Greek 210 (Second-Year Greek), or equivalent training in ancient Greek, is a prerequisite for this course.
