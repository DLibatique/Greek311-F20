## Course Texts

1. Fisher, Nick, ed. 2001. *Aeschines:* Against Timarchos. Oxford and New York.
2. Various articles and readings that will be provided in PDF form or found online (links will be provided in the course schedule).

The cost of books should never be a deterrent to participation in a class that you want to take. If you have trouble affording our course books, please let me know, and I will work to get you affordable copies through the resources of the College.
